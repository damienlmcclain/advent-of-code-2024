My Advent of Code 2024 Repository!

To pull data automatically from the AOC website, follow the instructions (here)[wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim#1]. Then locally create a file called session_cookie.py and add your session cookie to it as a str variable called AOCD_SESSION_COOKIE.

To run the tests, use pytest. To run the formatter, use yapf from the appropriate folder level (yapf -ir .). Flake8 can also be used (flake8).
